_**Difficulties**:_

	-Keeping the direction of the snake head consistant with direction.
	-Changing the color of the segments.
	-Recognizing collisions
	-Fixing the delay
	-Moving the segments along with the snake
	-Getting game to close (when using pygame)

**_Things I Enjoyed:_**

	-Creating the skeleton of the game.
	-Using something I am comfortable with (Turtle) and not having to refer back and forth to something.
	-Seeing the final product.
	
**_Things I Learned:_**
	
	-How to use turtle at an advanced level
	-How to use lists, coordinates, delays
	-Improving in the use of for loops, while True statements, if and or statements
	-Lines of code with 3 back slashes (///) are lines I added from others codes.
